    "\n",
    "\"\"\" In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is used to initialize \n",
    "and set up the attributes of an object created from that class. The constructor method is \n",
    "typically named __init__() and is automatically called when you create a new instance of a \n",
    "class. Its primary purpose is to initialize the instance variables or attributes of \n",

    "Purpose of Constructors:\n",

    "The main purpose of constructors in Python is to initialize the attributes or properties \n",
    "of an object when an instance of a class is created. Constructors help ensure that objects \n",

    "state and perform any necessary setup or validation during object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage of Constructors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object by assigning \n",
    "initial values to its attributes. This ensures that the object has a valid and defined \n",
    "state from the moment it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute Assignment: Constructors allow you to assign values to instance variables or \n",
    "attributes based on the arguments provided when creating an instance. This is useful for \n",
    "customizing the properties of individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default Values: Constructors can provide default values for parameters, making it \n",
    "convenient to create objects with some attributes pre-set while still allowing \n",
    "customization when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Constructors can be used to enforce encapsulation by initializing private \n",
