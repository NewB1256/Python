    "\n",
    "\"\"\" Composition and inheritance are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming \n",
    "(OOP), and they are used to achieve code reuse and create relationships between classes.\n",
    "However, they serve different purposes and have distinct advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "Here are the key differences between composition and inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Type:\n",
    "Composition: Composition is a \"has-a\" relationship, where one class contains an instance of\n",
    "another class as an attribute. It represents a relationship where one class is composed of\n",
    "or uses another class to achieve its functionality.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is an \"is-a\" relationship, where a new class (derived or subclass)\n",
    "inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (base or superclass). It \n",
    "represents a relationship where one class is a specialized version of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reuse:\n",
    "Composition: Composition promotes code reuse by allowing you to create complex objects by \n",
    "combining simpler objects or classes as components. Each component can be used in various \n",
    "contexts independently.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing you to inherit properties and \n",
    "methods from a base class. However, it can lead to a tight coupling between classes, making\n",
    "it less flexible in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "Composition: Composition provides greater flexibility because you can easily change or \n",
    "replace components without affecting the entire structure. It allows for more dynamic \n",
    "relationships between objects.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance can be less flexible because it creates a static relationship \n",

    "to unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",

    "multiple other classes as attributes, providing a way to combine various functionalities \n",
    "flexibly.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\" Using composition over inheritance in Python offers several benefits, particularly in \n",
    "terms of code flexibility and reusability. Here are some of the advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "Composition allows you to create dynamic and flexible relationships between objects. You \n",
    "can change or replace components (composed objects) without impacting the entire structure.\n",
    "It enables you to mix and match components to build more complex objects, providing greater\n",
    "adaptability to different use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity:\n",
    "Composition promotes modularity by encapsulating functionality within components. Each \n",
    "component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. Modifications or \n",
    "enhancements to a specific component do not necessarily affect other parts of the codebase,\n",
    "reducing the risk of unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "Composition encourages code reuse by allowing you to reuse existing classes (components) in\n",
    "various contexts. You can use the same component in different compositions, promoting a \n",
    "higher degree of code reusability. This reusability minimizes code duplication and ensures \n",
    "that well-tested and well-structured components can be employed in multiple parts of your \n",
    "application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Coupling:\n",
    "Composition typically results in looser coupling between classes. Each class is less \n",
    "dependent on the internal details of other classes, making the codebase less fragile. In \n",
    "contrast, inheritance can lead to tight coupling, where changes in a base class can affect \n",
    "all derived classes, potentially causing ripple effects throughout the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easier Maintenance:\n",
    "With composition, maintaining and extending your codebase is often more straightforward. \n",
    "Changes to one component typically have limited impact, and you can easily introduce new \n",
    "components or replace existing ones as needed. Inheritance can make code maintenance more \n",
    "challenging, as changes in base classes can propagate throughout the class hierarchy, \n",
    "potentially requiring extensive modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding the Diamond Problem:\n",
    "In Python, when dealing with multiple inheritance (a feature supported by the language), \n",
    "composition can help avoid the \"diamond problem,\" a common issue where multiple inheritance\n",
    "leads to ambiguity in method resolution. Composition offers a more controlled way to \n",

    "components can become challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential for Tight Coupling:\n",
    "In some cases, composition can lead to tight coupling between objects, where changes in one\n",
    "component affect other components or the overall behavior of the composed object. This \n",
    "tight coupling can make the code less maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Initialization:\n",
    "Initializing complex objects with multiple components can be cumbersome. Constructors may \n",
    "become lengthy and require careful parameter passing to ensure proper composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing Lifecycles:\n",
    "Components may have different lifecycles, and managing their creation, destruction, and \n",

    "complex code.\n",

    "Debugging and Testing:\n",
    "Debugging and testing can become more challenging when dealing with composed objects. \n",
    "Identifying the source of issues and isolating them to specific components can be \n",

    "\n",
    "Inconsistent Interfaces:\n",

    "\n",
    "Maintenance Complexity:\n",

    "work together correctly, and making changes without introducing regressions can become \n",
    "complex and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",

    "In languages that support multiple inheritance, the \"diamond problem\" can occur when a \n",

    "\"\"\" Achieving flexibility in composed objects by allowing them to be replaced or modified \n",
    "dynamically at runtime can be accomplished using various design patterns and techniques. \n",
    "Here are some approaches to achieve such flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Classes and Interfaces:\n",
    "Define abstract classes or interfaces that represent the common contract for the components \n",
    "that can be composed. This allows you to create different concrete implementations of \n",
    "components that adhere to the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factory Method Pattern:\n",
    "Use the Factory Method pattern to create instances of components dynamically based on \n",
    "specific criteria or configurations. This way, you can switch between different \n",
    "implementations of components at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Injection:\n",
    "Implement Dependency Injection to inject dependencies (components) into an object's \n",
    "constructor or methods. This allows you to replace or modify the components externally, \n",
    "making the composed object more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Service Locator Pattern:\n",
    "Implement the Service Locator pattern to centralize the creation and management of component\n",
    "s. This enables you to switch implementations or configurations by updating the service \n",
    "locator without changing the composed objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy Pattern:\n",
    "Apply the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate algorithms or behaviors within interchangeable \n",
    "strategy objects. By switching the strategy object at runtime, you can modify the behavior\n",
    "of the composed object.\n",
