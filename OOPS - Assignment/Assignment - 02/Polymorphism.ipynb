    "Inheritance: In Python, classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes. A base class \n",
    "(also known as a parent class or superclass) can define a method, and subclasses (also known as child classes or \n",
    "derived classes) can override that method with their own implementations. When you have a collection of objects of \n",
    "different classes that share a common base class, you can apply polymorphism by calling the same method on each \n",
